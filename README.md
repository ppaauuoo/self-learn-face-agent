# AI Vision Face Agent

An intelligent face recognition system built with DeepFace framework that utilizes OpenCV as the backend and VGG-Face as the recognition model. This project integrates with LangChain using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for advanced conversational AI capabilities.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition using DeepFace framework
- OpenCV backend for image processing
- VGG-Face model for accurate face recognition
- LangChain integration with Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent conversation
- Self-learning capabilities to improve recognition accuracy over time
- Gradio interface for easy interaction and testing

## Technology Stack
